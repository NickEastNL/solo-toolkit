# Foundry Solo RPG Toolkit

A suite of tools to aid with solo roleplaying using Foundry VTT.

**[NOTE]**: Documentation is being worked on.

## Token Vision
When selecting Tokens as a user with the Gamemaster role, it will show the Token's vision similar to that of a player controlling it. But this only applies when having the Tokens selected. This feature allows you to select one or more Tokens, such as those comprising your party, and lock their vision even when they are not selected.

The scene controls will provide buttons to open the configuration dialogue to assign Tokens, and a toggle to enable/disable the feature.

## Copy Message
A button is added to chat messages that allow you to copy their HTML contents. Currently, it will wrap this inside a callout box used by Obsidian.md, but in due course this will be customizable. At its core, it simply takes the HTML and clears all whitespace to turn into a single line of text.
